/*

There is a hidden connected unweighted graph with n nodes. We know the parity of dist(u, v) 
for all u, v. Find the original graph with n <= 500.

1. If dist(u, v) is even, there cant be an edge between them
2. If dist(u, v) is odd, there may be a edge between them

Adding any edge will not make a solution invalid because it will alter shortest path by 0 (even)
